Working laser focused on customer needs my teams and me were able to create **unique experiences** that delight both users and clients.

In the last yeas I helped our clients bringing websites to live, creating apps that improved the way people deal with their work and brought connected experiences to markets that were not yet familiar with an **agile mind set** and customer centricity.  

Starting my professional career in the web development I soon realized that not only creating well crafted websites was a topic I was very found of, but also that managing the projects was what I really was good at.

So I became a project manager. I learned the craft by getting out of my comfort zone, reading, taking courses, actually doing and, to be honest, by **failing and learning from mistakes**. 

On this journey I developed skills that are necessary to **initiate, plan, execute and successfully close projects** of multiple scales, from two-day projects, to Design Sprints  up to a year-long projects.

Lean UX, Design Thinking Workshops, Design Sprints, Kanban, Scrum, Jira, Confluence, Notion, Asana, Trello,
